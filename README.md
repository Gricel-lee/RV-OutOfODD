The repo is divided into two directories:

1. ```SAVE``` contains the code required for executing the process, and instructions for setup, including guidance for your own application. These can be found in ```SAVE/README.md```

2. ```evaluation``` contains scripts for generating usable data as described in the paper. This includes pre-deployment and deployment transition matrices, along with generating PRISM models and a plot for execution times.
